# Iteration determines time complexity for the most part

# Time complexity
**Single loop**
O(n)
**Nested loops**
O(n^2)
**Loop with Drastic Reduction (e.g., Binary Search)**
O(log n)
**Two non nested loops**
O(n + m)
**Loop with operations inside**
O(n) n for number of operations

# Space complexity
**Complex data structures arrays,maps,lists,queues,heaps,graphs,stacks**
O(n)
**Recursion (uses the call stack)**
O(n)
**Iteration (without storing data after each iteration)**
O(1)
**Single variables**
O(1)
